# Evolution of COVID-19 with first months data

In this brief report I make an attempt to create an adjustment model using an exponential function. In addition, the paper presents a comparison between the two European countries most affected to date: Spain and Italy. Argentina will also be studied.

It should be noted that this analysis was carried out of simple curiosity about the evolution of the disease and it only has some brushstrokes of what could be a more extensive project.
